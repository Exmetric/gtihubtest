Github Tutorial
This project is for the RaspberryPi 4, with an ultrasonic sensor connected on gpio pin 5 as a publisher transmiting data to "test.mosquitto.org" (1883) cloud server. Then the ultrasonic data is transfered to the subscriber from the server.
Indentations missing from code, instructions for packages missing, will add later :)
